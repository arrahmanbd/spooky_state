# Contributing to **spooky_state**

Welcome, quantum explorer! We're thrilled that you're considering contributing to **spooky_state**, the Flutter state management system where **wave-particle duality**, **entanglement**, and **superposition** come together to create an elegant and reactive experience.

To help maintain the cosmic balance of the **spooky_state** project, please follow these guidelines when contributing. Your contributions — whether small fixes, new features, or bug reports — will help enhance the universe of Flutter state management.

## How to Contribute

### 1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Make sure you're working in your own forked version of the project. This allows you to freely experiment without affecting the main codebase.
   
### 2. **Clone Your Fork**
   - Clone your fork locally:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/spooky_state.git
     cd spooky_state
     ```

### 3. **Create a Branch**
   - Always create a new branch for your changes. Make sure the branch name reflects the nature of the change. For example:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b fix-quantum-bug
     ```
   
### 4. **Make Your Changes**
   - Develop your feature or fix using the quantum principles of **reactivity** and **state entanglement**! Ensure your code is clear, well-commented, and follows the existing style.

### 5. **Run Tests**
   - Ensure that all tests pass before submitting your changes. We want to make sure that nothing gets **collapsed** prematurely:
     ```bash
     flutter test
     ```

### 6. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message. Be sure to use the **imperative mood** in your commit message (e.g., "Fix quantum wave collapse bug").
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Fix quantum wave collapse bug"
     ```

### 7. **Push Your Changes**
   - Push your changes to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin fix-quantum-bug
     ```

### 8. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Open a pull request from your fork to the main repository. Please include a detailed description of your changes, and why they matter to the **spooky_state** universe.
   - Make sure to check the **Quantum Guidelines** below to ensure your contribution aligns with the project's goals.

## Quantum Guidelines for Contributions

1. **Stay Reactive**: Ensure your changes maintain the **reactivity** of the system. We want state changes to ripple across the app like quantum waves.

2. **Follow the Code Style**: Stick to the existing coding style used in the repository. This will keep the codebase clean and easy to understand for all contributors.

3. **Document Your Code**: Just like the uncertainty principle, clarity is key. Ensure that all your changes are well-documented, and don't leave anything in a state of **superposition**.

4. **Write Tests**: If your contribution is a new feature or bug fix, be sure to add appropriate tests. We want the code to be robust and free of **entanglement bugs**.

5. **Respect the Entanglement**: Contributions should be well-integrated with the existing system. Ensure that your changes are compatible with the current design and architecture of **spooky_state**.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any **quantum anomalies** (bugs) or have suggestions for new features, please **open an issue** in the repository. Make sure to include a clear description of the problem, along with steps to reproduce it. Your feedback helps us keep the **spooky_state** in perfect **quantum harmony**.
