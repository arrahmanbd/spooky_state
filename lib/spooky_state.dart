/// ðŸŒ€ **spooky_state**: Quantum State Management for Flutter
///
/// This library leverages the mysteries of quantum mechanics to build a state management system that is reactive, scalable, and inspired by the strange behavior of particles and waves.
///
/// Each part of this library represents a fundamental aspect of quantum theory, making it easier to work with Flutter states while embracing the complexity and elegance of the quantum world.
///
/// **Library Structure:**
///
/// - **SchrÃ¶dingerBox**: A container that holds state in an uncertain superposition, collapsing only when observed (or interacted with).
/// - **WaveFunctionObserver**: Observers that collapse the state upon detection, much like how the wave function collapses when measured.
/// - **QuantumWaveform**: A representation of the state in its wave-like form, oscillating between potential values.
/// - **QuantumBuilderTypedef**: Typedefs for building quantum states in a type-safe, flexible manner, akin to the multi-state possibilities in quantum superposition.
/// - **ForbiddenQuantumCollapse**: Safeguards to prevent unauthorized or premature collapse of quantum states, ensuring stability and predictability.
/// - **QuantumExtensions**: Extensions that apply quantum principles to Flutter widgets, enhancing the reactivity and interconnectedness of state across the app.
///
/// The **spooky_state** library gives you tools to embrace state management at a quantum level â€” just like how particles influence each other over **spooky distances**, states here are **entangled**, reacting and evolving across your appâ€™s UI and logic.
